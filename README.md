## 🎯 Project Overview

**ProjectFlow** is a Kanban-style project management tool (similar to Trello/Asana) built as an internship capstone project. Each intern builds their own complete implementation from scratch, gaining hands-on experience with modern full-stack development.

### ✨ Key Features (Planned)

- 🔐 **Authentication** - Secure user authentication with Clerk
- 📊 **Project Management** - Create and manage multiple projects
- 📋 **Kanban Boards** - Drag-and-drop task management
- 👥 **Team Collaboration** - Task assignment and real-time updates
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- 🌓 **Theme Support** - Dark/Light mode toggle

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By completing this capstone, interns will demonstrate:

- ✅ Full-stack Next.js 16 development with App Router
- ✅ Server Components and Server Actions
- ✅ TypeScript for type-safe development
- ✅ PostgreSQL database design with Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Authentication and authorization with Clerk
- ✅ Client-side state management with Zustand
- ✅ Testing strategies (unit, integration, E2E)
- ✅ Git workflow and collaboration
- ✅ Production deployment and CI/CD

## 🌟 Current Status

This is an **active learning project** currently in the setup phase:

- ✅ **Foundation Complete**: Next.js 16 + React 19 upgrade
- ✅ **UI Mockups**: Landing page and dashboard layouts
- ✅ **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript types
- ⏳ **In Progress**: Component development
- 📝 **Planned**: Authentication, database, testing

## 🔄 Development Approach

### Individual Development
Each intern builds their own complete version by:
1. **Forking** this repository
2. **Working independently** through all phases
3. **Building** the entire stack from start to finish
4. **Owning** their complete portfolio project

### Collaborative Learning
Despite individual development, interns collaborate through:
- Daily standups sharing progress and blockers
- Code review sessions for learning
- Technical discussions on implementation approaches
- Knowledge sharing and problem-solving

## 🤝 Contributing

This is an internship learning project. Each intern maintains their own fork and develops independently.
